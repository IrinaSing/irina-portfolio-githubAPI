# Constraints

I have just around 5 days for this project, so I am going to follow these constraints to make it on time:

- To use visual design layout from my previous portfolio project.
- To use Bootstrap for CSS (same as for previous portfolio).
- To use same backlog as previous portfolio project, because user goals remain the same.
- If there is more time left - change design and add CSS effects for entertainment.
